            case .TouchDown:
                return "You deftly land your ship near where the distress signal originated. You didn't notice anything strange on your fly-by, behind you is an abandoned rover from the early 21st century and a small crate."

                return "You continue your course to Earth. Two days later, you receive a transmission from HQ saing that they have detected some sort of anomaly on the surface of Mars near an abandoned rover. They ask you to investigate, but ultimately the decision is yours because your mission has already run much longer than planned and supplies are low."

In fact, there is a message on the screen. \"\(name), Come to 28.2342, -81.08273. These coordinates aren't far but you don't know if your oxygen will last there and back.\""

            case .Crate:
                return "Unlike everything else around you the crate seems new and...alien. As you examine the create you notice something glinting on the ground beside it. Aha, a key! It must be for the crate..."
            case .Monster:
                return "You pick up the key and try to unlock the crate, but the key breaks off in the keyhole.You scream out in frustration! Your scream alerts a creature that captures you and takes you away..."

                return "After a long walk slightly uphill, you end up at the top of a small crater. You look around and are overjoyed to see your robot friend, \(name)-S1124. It had been lost on a previous mission to Mars. You take it back to your ship and fly back to Earth."
            case .Home:
                return "You arrive home on Earth. While your mission was a success, you forever wonder what was sending that signal. Perhaps a future mission will be able to investigate."
